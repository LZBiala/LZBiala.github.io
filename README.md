Heroku demo: https://tornado-visualization.herokuapp.com/

* Cost impact of tornado based on tornado magnitude interactive D3 bubble chart
* Leaflet interactive map displaying year and state with descriptions of the magnitude of the tornado and the distance
* Plotly graphs displaying some inferences and trends
  
# [ETL Project: ETL process on job demand in data science](https://github.com/LZBiala/ETL_group_project)

* ETL process on job demand and data science roles in 2019.
* Created a database called “DataSciDB" in the MongoDB environment.

# [Data Project 3: Develop 3 classifiers to predict potential breast cancer using our dataset](https://github.com/LZBiala/dataproject3)

We compared the accuracy of the three classifiers because we believe we’ll find some good inferences from these models from our dataset.

Classifiers used were: 
<br>
* Deep Learning Model <br>
* Logistic Regression Model <br>
* Support Vector Machine Model <br>
