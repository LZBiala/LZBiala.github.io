# [Data Project 2: Aggregated Tornado data in the United States from 1950 to 2018](https://github.com/LZBiala/dataproject2)

Heroku demo: https://tornado-visualization.herokuapp.com/

* Cost impact of tornado based on tornado magnitude interactive D3 bubble chart
* Leaflet interactive map displaying year and state with descriptions of the magnitude of the tornado and the distance
* Plotly graphs displaying some inferences and trends
  
# [ETL Project: ETL process on job demand in data science](https://github.com/LZBiala/ETL_group_project)

* Create a database called “DataSciDB in the MongoDB environment.
* Create a collection called “DS_Job_Categories” and insert data reflecting data science job categories into this collection
* Create a collection called “DS_Languages” and insert data reflecting languages used in the procuring and processing of data into this collection
* Create a collection called “Ml_Tools” and insert data reflecting current tools used for machine learning into this collection
* Create a collection called “Ml_Methods and insert data reflecting most widely used machine learning models for mapping and modelling of data into this collection

# [Data Project 3: Develop 3 classifiers to predict potential breast cancer using our dataset](https://github.com/LZBiala/dataproject3)

Classifiers used were: 
<br>
* Deep Learning Model <br>
* Logistic Regression Model <br>
* Support Vector Machine Model <br>

We compared the accuracy of the three classifiers because we believe we’ll find some good inferences from these models from our dataset.
